# Instructions 
Welcome to Fog Wizard and the Book of the Gods, a text-based adventure quest game.

To play this game, it's best to have novice understanding of Bash, the command language, since you will be playing in the Shell Terminal throughout your adventure.

Tips and guidance are given in these instructions.

Step 1 ) In the shell terminal upon starting the game you will see the tag ~/Fog-Wizard$. To access the game, you must first input the command "cd Game/".

** Tip: cd is the command line used to access files within a directory **

Now the shell terminal will say ~/Fog-Wizard/Game$. Now to start the game, input the command "python main.py".

** Tip: You do not have to type out the entire file name (main.py). Simply type 'm' or 'ma' and press Tab. The computer knows what you're referring to and will automate your input.**

Step 2 ) The game has started! If the game asks a question, it's best to answer to go further in the game. The game will first ask for your name or whatever alias you want to use. Simply type your name.

Step 3 ) Once you have gotten to the pivotal part of reading your first riddle, your goal is to explore! Exit out of the game file with the command "cd .." . This will take you back to ~/Fog-Wizard$ where you need to type "cd Wonders/". 

Step 4 ) You are now in the Quest Realm! The world is at your fingertips. Type the command "ls" to see what locations you can venture to.

Step 5 ) Use the command "python" + the name of a location to go to a Wonder in the Quest Realm.

Step 6 ) You've probably encountered items or a character in a Wonder. Don't forget to collect the items you need for the Fog Wizard.

Step 7) Once you've collected all the request items, head back to the Fog Wizard's chambers to check if your items are correct.


# Poison And Potion
1. Poison and potion is a mini game you  play against the Giant Theodore to access the items in Giant's Sky Mansion. 


2. Poison and potion is equivalent to the universal gambling game *Blackjack*. 


3. Blackjack is a popular gambling card game in which players attempt to make a hand as close as possible to a sum of 21 without going over.


4. Each player is dealt an initial hand of 2 cards. The first player may then choose to hit (draw another card into their hand) or stand, which means keep their current hand, and play passes to the next player.


5.  A player may hit as many times as they want, but if they go over 21, they POISON - or automatically lose.


6. In determining hand totals, face cards (Apprentice, Maiden, King's Council) are worth 10. Wizards are always worth 11.
